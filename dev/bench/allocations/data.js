          "message": "ci: run and publish benchmarks from GitHub Actions (#175)\n\nAdds a workflow that runs the BenchmarkDotNet suites on every push to main\nand on demand, writes the results table to the job summary, and uploads the\nfull artifacts.\n\nOn main it also records two series on an orphan benchmark-data branch via\ngithub-action-benchmark. They are split because the thresholds have to be\ndifferent: wall clock gets 200% and does not fail the build, since hosted\nrunners are shared VMs and anything tighter is all false positives, while\nallocated bytes get 105% and do fail. Two runs of the suites moved\nallocations by at most 0.24%, so a 5% gate sits well outside the noise.\n\nThe allocations series exists at all because github-action-benchmark's\nBenchmarkDotNet adapter reads only Statistics.Mean and ignores\nMemoryDiagnoser, so the numbers are extracted from the same report with jq\nand fed in as a custom series.\n\nNothing serves benchmark-data. GitHub Pages allows one source per\nrepository and the documentation site will own it, so the charts the action\ngenerates alongside the data are ignored; the docs build renders the series\nitself at release time.",
